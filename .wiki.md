# Project Summary
The Password Vault CLI project is an open-source command-line interface designed for secure, offline password management. It employs local-only encryption with Argon2id for key derivation and AES-256-GCM for data encryption, ensuring that sensitive information remains private and secure. The application supports multiple profiles for different environments (e.g., development, production) and includes features such as clipboard integration, encrypted export/import, master passphrase rotation, and audit logging. It is tailored for developers and security-conscious users who prioritize data protection without relying on network connectivity.

# Project Module Description
## Functional Modules
- **Cryptography Module:** Implements Argon2id and AES-256-GCM for secure key derivation and encryption.
- **Storage Module:** Manages encrypted data storage with BoltDB.
- **CLI Module:** Provides user commands for password management.
- **Testing Module:** Features unit, integration, and security tests to ensure robustness.

# Usage
To install dependencies, build, and run the Password Vault CLI:

1. Install Go 1.21 or later and set up your Go environment.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `go mod download` to install dependencies.
4. Build the CLI with `make build`.
5. Execute the CLI with `./build/vault`.

## Basic Commands
```bash
# Initialize a new vault
vault init

# Unlock the vault
vault unlock

# Add your first password
vault add github --username myuser --url https://github.com

# Retrieve a password (copies to clipboard)
vault get github --copy

# List all entries
vault list

# Lock the vault when done
vault lock
```
